                        to the phone. The Spot-5 Pro now has replaced the old virtual assistant to
                        Bernie Sanders! He can give you political insites on your questions and you
                        even spawn a hollogram for more realistic conversation.

                    <p>We wanted to cut corners on this phone but we didnt have the tools to do so,
                        and it would pose a potential risk of paper cuts. So, we made the cameras cuts
                        corners. With the -69:-420 aspect ratio, you can get every angle of nothing.

                    <h1>Internet Explorer</h1>
                    <p>We found that users are overwhelmed by the ammount of apps that were on their
                        screen and wanted to change that, so the new Spot-5 Pro has one app to do it
                        all. Internet Explorer. Why? because you can do anything with internet explorer
                        and its state-of-the-art technology. Loading speeds have been dramatically reduced
                        from never to only 10 minutes!

                        their phone with long nails. In result, our lawyers have told us to remove the touch screen.
                        To operate your phone, you must plug it in to your laptop and buy our software for $99.99 (software
                        not included) and use it to navigate your phone.
